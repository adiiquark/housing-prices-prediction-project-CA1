# housing-prices-prediction-project-CA1
This is a housing prices prediction model that uses 
linear regression to predict the prices of the houses 
according to the dataset used. Concepts of correlation
have been used and the trends have been plotted on graphs
and a heatmap. After the predictions the Rsquared error 
and mean absolute error has been calculated  which come
out to be 0.782749 and 0.36891 respectively.
